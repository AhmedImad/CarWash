## SQL Database Files

This repository includes SQL database dump files that are essential for running the CarWash application. The SQL files are located in the `sql-dumps` directory. These files contain the necessary database schema and initial data required for the application to function properly.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Import the SQL File:** In your preferred MySQL database management tool, create a new database named `carwashdb`. Then, import the `carwashdb.sql` file from the `sql-dumps` directory into this database. This will set up the required schema and initial data.

3. **Configure Database Connection:** In the `dbConnect.py` file, make sure to update the database connection parameters (host, user, password) according to your MySQL configuration.

4. **Run the Application:** With the database properly set up, you can now run the CarWash application using `python main.py`.

By including the SQL files in this repository, we ensure that anyone can easily set up and run the application without having to create the database schema manually.
